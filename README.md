# FoldingCell-Expandable-View-

A foldingCell expandable tableview is a tableview that “allows” its cells to expand and collapse in a foldable manner, showing and hiding that way other cells that in any other case would be always visible. Creating expandable table views with foldiable animation is a better alternative when it's required to gather simple data, or to display on-demand information to users.
